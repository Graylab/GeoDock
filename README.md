Official repository for [GeoDock](https://doi.org/10.1002/pro.4862): Flexible Protein-Protein Docking with a Multi-Track Iterative Transformer.

GeoDock is a novel multi-track iterative transformer network designed to address limitations in conventional protein-protein docking algorithms and existing deep learning methods. It is capable of predicting docked structures from separate docking partners, allowing for flexibility at the protein residue level to accommodate conformational changes upon binding. GeoDock attains an average inference speed of under one second on a single GPU, enabling its application in large-scale structure screening.
